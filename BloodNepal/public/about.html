        <h1>About Blood Nepal</h1>
        <p class="lead">Our mission is to bridge the gap between blood donors and those in need of blood transfusions across Nepal.</p>
    
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>At Blood Nepal, our mission is to create a seamless connection between blood donors and those in dire need of blood transfusions throughout Nepal. We aim to establish a robust network of donors, volunteers, and medical professionals to ensure timely, safe, and efficient blood donations. Through our efforts, we aspire to save lives and improve the health outcomes for many across the country.</p>
    
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We envision a Nepal where everyone has access to safe, sufficient, and timely blood transfusions when required. Our goal is to raise awareness about the critical importance of blood donation and encourage a culture where regular blood donation is seen as a social responsibility. By fostering a community of committed donors and supporters, we strive to ensure that no one suffers due to a lack of blood availability.</p>
    
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Blood Nepal was founded in 2024 by a group of four dedicated individuals: Raman Maharjan, Sabal Shahi, Laxman Shrestha, and Ritik Bajoria. These founders recognized the urgent need for a reliable and equitable blood donation system in Nepal. Observing the increasing demand for blood and the absence of a centralized platform, they established Blood Nepal to address these challenges. Since our inception, we have connected countless donors with recipients, organized numerous blood donation camps, and empowered individuals to donate blood and spread awareness. Our journey is fueled by a commitment to fairness, equality, and the betterment of health services in Nepal.</p>
